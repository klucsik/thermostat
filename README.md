## Noszlop Greenhouse project
Various automations for a greenhouse at my fathers place in a rural village called Noszlop.
This project is my entry drug for IT, I working on this since 2014.

### Background
My father work a lot in his garden, he growns his own tomatoes and paprikas. He starts the process with germinateion. He puts the seeds in soil, and put those in a "reverse refigerator": Once was a refigerator, now it has a 100W lightbulb in it as a heatsource, and its job is to provide a nice 28 CÂ° temperature and humid air for the germination.
After that, the young seedlings (around 2000 pieces) moves to the greenhouse. This usually happens in the early spring when it is a chance for night freezes, that would kill those poor seedlings. So before I started this porject father barely slept for about two weeks, checking the temperature hourly at nights.

I thought this shouldn't be that hard to automate, father should get enough sleep, so I started to learn building sensors, switching relays, collectiong and processing data. And code.

### The requirements
* The seedlings can't bee freeze to death.
* If some part of the system is fails, the others should work normally
* If some part is failing, there should be an alarm
* Father needs to see the actual data in the house (~100m away from the greenhouse)
* The system should be maintained remotely (as I not live in there anymore, and father won't be able to build and upload new firmware to the devices)
